## Modify permissions

While going thru the labs, when the documentation states something like:

```
"The caller needs the `Application.Read.All` permission"
``` 

This means that the Graph Explorer needs to have the `Application.Read.All` permission granted. You can do this by clicking on the **Modify permissions** tab and selecting the required permission.

For most of the APIs graph explorer will automatically suggest the required permissions.

In some cases you may need to manually add the required permission. You can do this by clicking on **open  permissions panel** and searching for the required permission.

On clicking **Add permissions** you will be prompted to grant admin consent for the permission. You can do this by clicking on **Consent**.
